# text-reverser
A terrible website that reverses text that you enter in a textbox using terribly written code.


**I didn't add a license because:**
1. The code is literally **so** simple that anyone can write it, and therefore anyone can EASILY replicate it; this is not some new or unique creation;
just a terrible version of a common tool people will need ðŸ¤£

2. You **can** take the code...if I ever remember to keep the repository public :)
  (*It's that simple!*)

3. Licenses scare me; I don't want to read a lot of legal documentation and misunderstand it or whatever!

**THIS PROJECT USES THE p5.js JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY!**
**+ Poorly written code, some badly done CSS and HTML,** done by an idiot (Oh wait, that's a disrespect to idiots!) called @Brahvim.
